/// From experiments sometimes we miss rotate the pieces by choosing the wrong angle. This append
/// most of the time with peices with 3 holes and 1 bump. In order to fix those pieces we tried
/// to make a quality check based on properties expected for the 8 points extracted from the picture
/// (4 corners and 4 holes/bump).
/// From this we can detect badly analysed pieces and maybe make a brut force search with all rotation
/// angle to find one with better quality.
/// In order to proceed we check various constrain and attribute a quality mark.
